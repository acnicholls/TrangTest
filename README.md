# TrangTest

Test for Paul Trang's AEC Project

This project was given to me in early 2018 as an assignment toward employment. I had a weekend to prove that I can code in C#. The application will convert and display temperatures as well as alert the user when certain criteria are met

# Versions

There are now a few different versions of this project.

1. the original application that I submitted to the employer
2. the updated application that also converts and displays Kelvin temperatures
3. an application that fixes several bugs I found in the data input and validation
4. added workflows to build, tag and release the built application
