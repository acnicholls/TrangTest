# TrangTest
Test for Paul Trang's AEC Project

This project was given to me in early 2018 as an assignment toward employment.  I had a weekend to prove that I can code in C#.  The application will convert and display temperatures as well as alert the user when certain criteria are met

# Versions
There are now three different versions of this project.  
1. the original application that I submitted to the employer
2. the updated application that also converts and displays Kelvin temperatures
3. an application that fixes several bugs I found in the data input and validation
